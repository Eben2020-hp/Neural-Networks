# Neural Networks From Scratch


## What are Neural Networks?
It is a computer system model completly inspired by the human brain and its components (nervous system). A neural network is composed of many simple processing elements (nodes) which are operating in parallel.

### Biological Neural Networks
The human brain consists of huge number of neurons (approximately 10^11 neurons).

The above figure has 3 main parts:
- **Some** -> Where the Cell Nucleus is located.
- **Dendrites** -> Where the nerve is connected to the cell body. It is a tree like network made up of fibers.
- **Axon** -> Single long connection extended from the cell body which carries signal from neuron.

### Understanding Neural Networks with Biological Neural Networks 

| Biological Neural Network | Neural Network |
| --- | --- |
| Cell | Neuron |
| Dendrites | Weights or Interconnections |
| Soma | Net Input |
| Axon | Output |

In this repository we will be exploring the basic idea on how a Neural Network is being built with the help of **Numpy** rather than the other prominent libraries like **PyTorch** or **Keras**.

- We have created a Simple neural network with the following characteristics:-  
  - One Input Layer (3 unique ***Input Neurons***)
  - Three unique ***Weights***
  - One ***Bias***
  - One Output Layer (1 ***Output Neurons***)

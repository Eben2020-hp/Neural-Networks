# Neural Networks Scratch


## What are Neural Networks?
It is a computer system model completly inspired by the human brain and its components (nervous system). A neural network is composed of many simple processing elements (nodes) which are operating in parallel.

In this repository we will be understanding the basic idea on how a Neural Network is being built with the help of **Numpy** rather than the other prominent libraries like **PyTorch** or **Keras**.
